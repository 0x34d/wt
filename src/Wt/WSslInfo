 *  \brief Provides SSL information about the current session.
 *  
 * This class provides an interface to the SSL information related
 * to the current session. This class is returned by
 * WEnvironment::sslInfo().
 *
 * Probably the most important use of this class is that it provides
 * access to the client certificate which was presented by the
 * client during an https handshake to authenticate the SSL session.
 * This class collects the information on the verification that was
 * performed by the connector (FCGI, ISAPI, the built-in webserver, ...)
 * and presents it to the application programmer.
 *
 * The verification and the acceptance of the certificate has to be
 * configured in the web server (built-in httpd, Apache, IIS, ...).
 * When WEnvironment::sslInfo() returns an WSslInfo object, this
 * means that the client verification has already passed the
 * verification procedures in the webserver. This does not mean
 * that the certificate is valid; depending on the configuration
 * of your web server, this verification may be weak. Always
 * check the verification result with clientVerificationResult().
 *
 * This class is only available when %Wt was compiled with SSL support.

 *
 * This provides a connection pool of fixed size: its size is determined at
 * startup time, and the pool will not grow as more connections are needed.
 *
 * This is usually adequate when the number of threads (which need
 * different connections to work with) is also bounded. This is for
 * example the case when a thread pool is used, such as in the case
 * for %Wt. Note that you do not need as many connections as sessions,
 * since Session will only use a connection while processing a
 * transaction.

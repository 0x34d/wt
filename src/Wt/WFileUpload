/*! \class WFileUpload Wt/WFileUpload Wt/WFileUpload
 *  \brief A widget that allows a file to be uploaded.
 *
 * This widget is displayed as a box in which a filename can be entered and
 * a browse button.
 *
 * Depending on availability of JavaScript, the behaviour of the widget
 * is different, but the API is designed in a way which facilitates
 * a portable use.
 *
 * When JavaScript is available, the file will not be uploaded until
 * upload() is called. This will start an asynchronous upload (and
 * thus return immediately). When the file has been uploaded, the
 * uploaded() signal is emitted, or if the file was too large, the
 * fileTooLarge() signal is emitted.
 *
 * When no JavaScript is available, the file will be uploaded with the
 * next click event. Thus, upload() is not useful -- the file will
 * already be uploaded, and the corresponding signals will already be
 * emitted. To test if upload() is needed, you may check using the
 * isUploaded() call.
 *
 * Thus, to properly use the widget, one needs to follow these
 * rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Be prepared to handle the uploaded() or fileTooLarge() signals
 *       also when upload() was not called.</li>
 *   <li>Check with isUploaded() if upload() will schedule a new
 *       upload. if (isUploaded()) then upload() will no have any
 *       effect. if (!isUploaded()), upload() will start and end
 *       when either of the two uploaded() or fileTooLarge()
 *       signals gets emitted.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The %WFileUpload widget must be hidden or deleted when a file is
 * received. In addition it is wise to prevent the user from uploading
 * the file twice as in the example below.
 *
 * The uploaded file is automatically spooled to a local temporary
 * file which will be deleted together with the WFileUpload widget,
 * unless stealSpooledFile() is called.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 * Wt::WFileUpload *upload = new Wt::WFileUpload(this);
 * upload->setFileTextSize(40);
 *
 * // Provide a button
 * Wt::WPushButton *uploadButton = new Wt::WPushButton("Send", this);

 * // Upload when the button is clicked.
 * uploadButton->clicked().connect(SLOT(upload, Wt::WFileUpload::upload));
 * uploadButton->clicked().connect(SLOT(uploadButton, Wt::WPushButton::disable));
 *
 * // Upload automatically when the user entered a file.
 * upload->changed().connect(SLOT(upload, WFileUpload::upload));
 * upload->changed().connect(SLOT(uploadButton, Wt::WPushButton::disable));
 *
 * // React to a succesfull upload.
 * upload->uploaded().connect(SLOT(this, MyWidget::fileUploaded));
 *
 * // React to a fileupload problem.
 * upload->fileTooLarge().connect(SLOT(this, MyWidget::fileTooLarge));
 * \endcode
 *
 * The file upload itself corresponds to a <tt>&lt;input
 * type="file"&gt;</tt> tag, but may be wrapped in a
 * <tt>&lt;form&gt;</tt> tag.
 *
 * %WFileUpload is an \link WWidget::setInline(bool) inline \endlink widget.
 *

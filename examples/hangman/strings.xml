      Hangman keeps track of the best players, and since that could be
      you, you might want to login under you own name. If you never
      logged in before, choose any name and password. If you would
      rather not register for some reason, use the <b>guest/guest</b>
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warning: hangman contains some words and pictures that may
      offend really young players.

      For each game won, you gain 20 points, minus one point for each
      wrong letter guess.  <br /> For each game lost, you loose 10
      points, so you better try hard to guess the word!
